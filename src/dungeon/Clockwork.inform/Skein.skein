Clockwork Descent
An Interactive Fiction by Andrew Brookins
Release 1 / Serial number 250509 / Inform 7 v10.1.2 / D

Aerial Platform
You stand on a wind-swept sky dock atop a flying clockwork airship platform attached to the tower. Gears whirr, propellers spin, and steam vents hiss around you. A dirigible is moored to a spire to the east. A cargo crane stands nearby, currently misaligned, blocking a large elevator hatch in the floor. A narrow metal gantry extends toward the tower's edge, creaking ominously.

A battered metal toolbox, likely holding useful tools.

A reinforced wooden crate stamped with the airship's insignia.

A small clockwork automaton tinkerer clings to the gantry, its right leg hinge loose.

You can also see an elevator hatch, a crane, the Raven and a Steam Valve here.

You can go down through the elevator hatch (closed) from here.
